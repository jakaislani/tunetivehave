Surrounded by his loved ones at Bryan East, Todd left this world peacefully, leaving behind a legacy of selflessness, hard work, and boundless love.&nbsp;Born on April 27, 1967, in Crete, Todd’s journey through life was marked by his dedication to his family, his community, and the principles he held dear. He was baptized and confirmed on October 18, 1987, a testament to his faith that guided him throughout his life.</p><p>Todd was a gentle giant, a towering figure known for his kind heart and compassionate nature. His commitment to hard work was evident in every aspect of his life, from his roles as a loving husband and father to his endeavors as a dedicated businessman.&nbsp;For 36 remarkable years, Todd shared his life with his beloved wife, Lisa. Their marriage was a testament to the strength of love, enduring through life’s challenges and joys. Todd and Lisa were not just partners in marriage but pillars of support for each other, creating a bond that stood the test of time.</p><p>Todd’s journey as a businessman included an 11-year ownership of the Wilber Bakery, where he poured his passion into creating delightful treats for the community. Later, he transitioned to becoming a contractor, owning his own business and contributing to the growth of the local economy. His work ethic and commitment to excellence left an indelible mark on those who had the privilege of working alongside him.&nbsp;Beyond his professional pursuits, Todd and Lisa were active members of the Bellwood Methodist Church. Their faith played a central role in their lives, providing them with guidance and strength. Together, they found joy in attending church services and sharing their spiritual journey with family and friends.</p><p>One of Todd’s greatest joys in life was being a grandfather, affectionately known as “papa.” He took pleasure in spending quality time with his grandson, creating cherished memories and imparting valuable life lessons. Todd’s legacy of love extended beyond his immediate family, reaching into the hearts of his friends and community.&nbsp;In an act of incredible generosity, Todd made the selfless decision to donate his organs, providing the gift of life to others. Even in his passing, Todd continues to make a positive impact, embodying the spirit of kindness and compassion that defined his life.</p><p>As we mourn the loss of Todd, let us remember the gentle giant, the hardworking businessman, the devoted husband and father, the loyal friend, and the best papa. May his legacy inspire us to live with love, compassion, and a commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKyfmbFuscyeoKCgXaSvqsDUmqmyZaeeuaOx0WalnmWfrLumvoyonWadnZq2qLSMnKanq6SnwqTAyKilZpufor2iuthmn5qrXZm2prCO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html&text=Todd%20Emeigh%20Obituary%20Wilber%20NE%2c%20Owner%20of%20Emeigh%20Construction%20Company%20Has%20Died&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html&title=Todd%20Emeigh%20Obituary%20Wilber%20NE%2c%20Owner%20of%20Emeigh%20Construction%20Company%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html&title=Todd%20Emeigh%20Obituary%20Wilber%20NE%2c%20Owner%20of%20Emeigh%20Construction%20Company%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html&title=Todd%20Emeigh%20Obituary%20Wilber%20NE%2c%20Owner%20of%20Emeigh%20Construction%20Company%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftodd-emeigh-obituary-wilber-ne-owner-of-emeigh-construction-company-has-died.html&description=Todd%20Emeigh%20Obituary%20Wilber%20NE%2c%20Owner%20of%20Emeigh%20Construction%20Company%20Has%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-marzipan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Marzipan, Actually? | Sporked">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./phantasm-ravager-2016.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Phantasm: Ravager movie review (2016)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
