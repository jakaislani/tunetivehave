As a professional soccer player, goalkeeper Matthew Turner plays for the United States national team and Premier League club Arsenal. Matt began playing football at the age of 14, and Landon Donovan’s game-winning goal in the 2010 FIFA World Cup inspired him to pursue a professional football career. Turner began in goal for the United States men’s national team against Trinidad & Tobago in a friendly match on January 31, 2021. He stopped Alvin Jones’ penalty kick, preventing a goal. Turner also started all six games for the United States at the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p><p>He had five clean sheets, one of which came in the championship match against Mexico, which he won 1-0. Turner was named “Best Goalkeeper” in the tournament for his efforts. Turner was selected for the United States Men’s National Team, which will compete in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November, as the team’s starting goalie.</p><h2>Matt Turner Religion: Is the NFL star Jewish or Christian?</h2><p>Matt Turner aligns with Jewish rather than Christian traditions. Turner’s Father’s paternal great-grandmother is Jewish, and she moved from Lithuania during World War II due to religious persecution.&nbsp;Turner’s surname was Anglicized from Turnovski to Turner upon immigration. His mother, on the other hand, is a fervent Catholic. Turner is so known to both faiths since his parents are both religious. Turner uncovered his great-emigration grandmother’s documents from Lithuania while he worked on his Lithuanian passport and European objectives.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Matt-Turner-1.jpg alt="Matt Turner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His father, who had also obtained a Lithuanian passport, got a call from Remi Roy, the goalkeeping coach at the time, encouraging him to join the team in preseason.&nbsp;Turner said that it would be tough to dismiss the idea of transferring to Europe, but he still has a lot to do in Foxborough.</p><h2>Matt Turner’s Ethnicity and Origins</h2><p><strong>Matt Turner</strong> was born on June 24, 1994, in New Jersey, United States, to parents.&nbsp;Stuart Turner and Cindy Turner, his parents, reared him in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Michelle Turner and Kelly Turner are his two older sisters.&nbsp;Cindy Turner, his mother, is a devout Catholic who grew up playing softball in Westwood, New Jersey.</p><p>She is now competing in a national over-50 team tournament. She had previously coached Matt’s elder sisters in softball.&nbsp;When the coronavirus epidemic hit New York City, his sister Michelle Turner, a frontline nurse, was there. Michelle used to be an operating room nurse and to help battle COVID-19, she converted her operating room into an intensive care unit.&nbsp;Matt and his father, Stuart, obtained Lithuanian passports in 2020.&nbsp;While Matt aspired to live in the United States, he also sought the option of migrating to Europe if his dream to compete for the United States national team was not realized.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Matt-Turner-2.jpg alt="Matt Turner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Matt Turner Assists Team USA In Qualifying For The World Cup’s Next Round In 2022</h2><p>For the first time since 1930, the USMNT has kept numerous clean sheets in a World Cup, due primarily to Matt Turner, who has come a long way from his college days.&nbsp;The feat came after the United States’ difficult 1-0 win against Iran on Tuesday when Iran put pressure on the Americans, but Turner only had to cope with one on-target shot.</p><p>Turner wasn’t put to the test too frequently in Group B, but when he was, he excelled. Wales and England both had three attempts on goal in their matches with the United States, but Turner made remarkable stops on Mason Mount and Ben Davies strikes to prevent particular goals.&nbsp;The lone goal Turner and the USMNT defense surrendered was Gareth Bale’s late penalty in the 1-1 tie with Wales.&nbsp;Turner has played excellently in 23 appearances for the United States, so his performance in Qatar will not surprise USA supporters. Turner has also made an impression as Arsenal’s No. 2 player.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqykYsG2vs2eqWavmaC2bsPHmqusZZiewG6x06GlopuZqcZuvsSloKChn6N6orrDZp2apZmhxnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html&text=Matt%20Turner%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Religion%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html&title=Matt%20Turner%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html&title=Matt%20Turner%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html&title=Matt%20Turner%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatt-turner-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family.html&description=Matt%20Turner%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20His%20Ethnicity%3f%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mini-ceviche-tacos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mini Ceviche Tacos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dan-pena-kids-their-age-net-worth-partners-how-many-children.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dan Pena Kids: Their Age, Net Worth &amp;amp; Partners  How Many Children?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
