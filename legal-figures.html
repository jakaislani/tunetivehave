The FBI created the alias of Brasco to stem the rising truck hijacking numbers, but Brasco was able to rise quickly within the ranks and be nominated for membership in the Bonanno crime family. Eventually, Brasco was pulled and the mission was ended for his safety.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">FBI Career</h2><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Bonanno Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1976 FBI undercover agent Joseph Pistone successfully infiltrated New York's Bonanno Mafia family. Going under the name of "Donnie Brasco," Pistone became close to several Mafia members during an assignment that lasted five years and the information he amassed over that time led to hundreds of arrests.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1974, Pistone was transferred to New York and assigned to the truck hijacking squad of the FBI. There were five to six major hijackings per day in the New York City area and intelligence sources indicated that all were somehow tied to various Mafia families. The FBI organized a six-month undercover operation, known as "Sun-Apple" to infiltrate the fences. The FBI gave Pistone a new identity as a small, but successful, jewel thief and burglar called Donnie Brasco.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pistone went to school to learn about precious gems, and the FBI set him up with an apartment in New York and one in Florida, while his family lived in another part of the country. He targeted bars and restaurants he knew were frequented by certain mob members until one day he got into a conversation with Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ruggiero had worked as a loyal foot soldier for the Mafia for 30 years and killed 26 people in total. Brasco impressed him and the two joined forces as business partners, with Ruggiero becoming his mentor and sponsor — if Brasco let the family down Ruggiero would pay with his own life.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Undercover with the Mob</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An average day would start with checking in with Ruggiero, Brasco's captain, and then hanging out in a bar or nightclub trying to think of new ways to make money or advancing up the Mafia ladder. Brasco always worked with the same people and never asked what other members were doing or even who they were. Too many questions were viewed with great suspicion and this rule complicated his undercover role and contributed to its longevity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During his time undercover, Brasco was ordered to commit four contract killings. There was no question of refusal, so Brasco would either manipulate himself out of the hit at a later date or, if that proved too difficult, the FBI would stage a fake killing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was able to see his wife Maggie and their three daughters once every three or four months for a day on average. Discussing the outlines or ramifications of the case would have been a breach of security, so his family had no idea what he was doing, which took a tremendous toll on their relationships.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On July 12, 1979, the head of the Bonanno family, Carmine Galante, was shot dead. A war broke out between the rival leaders within the family, which quickly split into two factions. In May 1981, Dominick "Sonny Black" Napolitano and Ruggiero killed three of the top members of the opposition and then Napolitano ordered Brasco to kill Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mafia Trials</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Brasco and the FBI planned to arrest Indelicato before the day of the hit, but they were unable to find him. Because of this incident and the shooting war being waged between the families, the FBI decided to end the operation. Brasco argued that he should stay until December when his membership into the family would be decided, but the FBI disagreed. The Mafia put a contract out on Brasco's life for half a million dollars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pistone and his family still live under secret identities in an undisclosed location in New Jersey. In 1986, he retired from the FBI and he currently works as an FBI consultant and lectures internationally. He's also the author of several books and the co-owner of a production company.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death of Napolitano</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Two days after the FBI pulled Brasco out of the operation they informed Napolitano that he had been working undercover. It was not long before Napolitano's death was ordered. On August 17, 1981, accepting his fate, Napolitano gave his favorite bartender his jewelry and the keys to his apartment so that his pet pigeons could be looked after. On August 12, 1982, his body was found in a creek on Staten Island. Another Bonanno boss, Joe Massino, was found guilty of ordering his death in 2004.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On August 30, 1981, the FBI arrested Ruggiero for his own protection, the same day that a contract was put out on him. He was sentenced to serve 20 years in prison but was released on parole in 1992. On Thanksgiving Day 1995, Ruggiero died of cancer in his New York home. He was 72.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The evidence collected by Brasco led to over 200 indictments and over 100 convictions. New York Mafia families have instituted new rules to thwart future undercover penetrations. Before a new member is made a soldier he must kill someone, and two family members, instead of one, must vouch with their own lives for him.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wife</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pistone's wife is Maggie, a former nurse. The couple has three daughters. The family lives in New Jersey under false identities.</p><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Donnie</li><li>Birth Year: 1939</li><li>Birth State: Pennsylvania</li><li>Birth City: Erie</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Donnie Brasco was the alias of Joseph Pistone, an undercover FBI agent that infiltrated the Bonanno crime family.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Crime and Terrorism</li><li>Law</li></ul><li>Schools</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Paterson State College</li></ul><li>Cultural Associations</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Italian American</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=42><ul data-node-id=44 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Donnie Brasco Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/law-figure/donnie-brasco</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: November 1, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGijnp%2BRoXqntcauqZ6rX5m8r7rInmSbqpGosLA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flegal-figures.html&text=Donnie%20Brasco%20-%20Movie%2c%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20FBI&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flegal-figures.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flegal-figures.html&title=Donnie%20Brasco%20-%20Movie%2c%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20FBI" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flegal-figures.html&title=Donnie%20Brasco%20-%20Movie%2c%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20FBI" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flegal-figures.html&title=Donnie%20Brasco%20-%20Movie%2c%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20FBI" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flegal-figures.html&description=Donnie%20Brasco%20-%20Movie%2c%20Life%20%26amp%3b%20FBI" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-tall-is-mikey-williams-and-how-does-his-height-compare-to-other-nba-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Tall is Mikey Williams and How Does His Height Compare To Other NBA Stars?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dicks-sporting-goods-is-launching-a-lululemon-rival-for-men.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dick's Sporting Goods is launching a Lululemon rival for men">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
