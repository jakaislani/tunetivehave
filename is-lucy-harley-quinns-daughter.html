She was raised by Three-Face and her stepfather, the Earth-3 Riddler, and together the three formed the Riddler Family.<h2>Is Harley Quinn The Jokers daughter?</h2>The Joker later returns in the Endgame storyline, very much alive. Much to the dismay of fellow member Harley Quinn, the Joker's Daughter is recruited as part of the New Suicide Squad.<h2>Joker and Harley Quinn's Daughter Lucy - Injustice 2</h2><p></p><h2>Is Lucy quinzel Joker's daughter?</h2>Lucy Quinzel is the daughter of the Joker and Harley Quinn and the niece of Delia Quinzel.<h2>Did Joker get Harley pregnant?</h2>After Harley Quinn finally got her true love story with Joker in Batman: White Knight, the sequel series reveals: that's not all she got.<h2>Is Catwoman The Penguins daughter?</h2>Duela Dent first appeared as Joker's Daughter in the Batman Family series of comic books. She gained the attention of Robin, as she later claimed to be the daughter of Catwoman, Scarecrow, the Riddler, and the Penguin.<h2>Who is the Joker's son?</h2>Joker Jr. was born after The Joker, who had manipulated Harley Quinn into re-entering a life of crime, impregnated her without her knowing. Harley out of shame refused to accept the child and gave him up. He grew up being transferred from various orphanages and foster homes to people who never loved him.<h2>What is the female Joker called?</h2>Harley Quinn is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Quinn was created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm as a comic relief henchwoman for the supervillain Joker in Batman: The Animated Series, and debuted in its 22nd episode, "Joker's Favor", on September 11, 1992.<h2>Does Poison Ivy marry kite man?</h2>Kite Man prepared his wedding with Poison Ivy, but became concerned over her rush, worrying about her. With the Parademons destroying everything, he asked if she didn't want to postpone for better conditions, but she vehemently said she wanted to move on with her life and that she loved him, which Kite Man appreciated.<h2>What is Joker's real name?</h2>Jack Napier, also known as the Joker, is a fictional character introduced in the 1989 superhero film Batman, directed by Tim Burton.<h2>Does Harley Quinn have a sister?</h2>Family. Delia Quinzel is the sister of Harley Quinn and the adoptive mother (aunt) of Lucy.<h2>Does Harley Quinn have grandkids?</h2>Twin sisters Delia and Deidre Dennis were the grandchildren of Harleen Quinzel. They joined the Jokerz under the joint alias "Dee Dee" and later followed in their grandmother's footsteps as "hench-wenches" of the original Joker.<h2>Did Joker have a wife?</h2>In Batman Confidential, the Joker's early years were completely retold, that time through Batman's point of view. There was no mention of the Joker ever having had a wife and his lifestyle choices (as documented by Batman) certainly didn't support that one.<h2>Did Robin become the Joker?</h2>In the DC Animated Universe's Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, former Robin Tim Drake was brainwashed and manipulated into becoming the new Joker after the original Clown Prince perished.<h2>Why did the Joker leave Harley Quinn?</h2>Based on the title alone, the movie seems to acknowledge that the relationship between Harley Quinn and Joker was abusive and Harley finally breaks away. “The fact that this movie touches on Joker and Harley Quinn's abusive relationship after so many fetishized it in Suicide Squad is funny,” wrote a Twitter user.<h2>Does Falcone know Catwoman is his daughter?</h2>Falcone doesn't know that Selina is his daughter; that's clear in the way he speaks about her when she does confront him. But knowing how Selina works, she's probably there to find his weaknesses so she can strike when necessary.<h2>Is there a female two face?</h2>Gilda Dent is Harvey Dent's wife. Her character debuted in Detective Comics #66, alongside Harvey, and became a recurring character in Batman stories involving Two-Face.<h2>Did Falcone know Catwoman was his daughter?</h2>It didn't click at the time during the film, but falcone knew who Selina was, it didn't know she was his daughter until later.<h2>Did Harley Quinn have a kid Suicide Squad?</h2>Yes, Harley had a daughter whom she let her sister raise. She left the Joker for a year to have said child because she feared that that learning he is a father would lead to a worsening in the Joker's mental state. Her name is Lucy.<h2>Why are there baby clothes in Suicide Squad?</h2>Two years after Suicide Squad's release, director David Ayer has explained that the reason Joker had baby clothes was because it was foreshadowing the vision Harley would have later on. As Ayer put it: Those are the same onesies the babies were wearing in Harley's fantasy vision.<h2>Does Harley Quinn have a kid Suicide Squad?</h2>In their "Year 2" arc, Harley is 100% confirmed to be a mom.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZKWtk656qa3RpZyyZaGqtq%2B60mabmq2XncGmvg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html&text=Is%20Lucy%20Harley%20Quinn%27s%20daughter%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html&title=Is%20Lucy%20Harley%20Quinn%27s%20daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html&title=Is%20Lucy%20Harley%20Quinn%27s%20daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html&title=Is%20Lucy%20Harley%20Quinn%27s%20daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-lucy-harley-quinns-daughter.html&description=Is%20Lucy%20Harley%20Quinn%27s%20daughter%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./best-musicians-who-played-vegas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Greatest Music Stars To Ever Play Las Vegas">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heath-ledger-fans-remember-joker-actor-anniversary-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heath Ledger Fans Remember The Actor On 13th Anniversary Of His Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
