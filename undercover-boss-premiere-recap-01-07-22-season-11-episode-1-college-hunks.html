Nick and Omar are the original college hunks. They met in high school during detention. They became fast friends and they were in college together when they got the bright idea to work part-time as movers. It was one of their mothers who named the company. They then used it and started putting out fliers around the neighborhood. They began with one van and eventually that turned to over three thousand large moving vans. And over a hundred and fifty franchises in thirty-nine states.</p><p>Omar and Nick became a success. They both went on to get married and have children. They ruled over a successful business until the pandemic happened. The pandemic changed everything. The business suffered and for a while they thought they might have to let people go, but business has since begun picking up again and everyone was making do with the new normal. Not that Omar and Nick let this believe their business is where it should be. They wanted to keep growing it in spite of the pandemic and that’s why they took such a drastic issue as going undercover. They got makeovers. They even worked on their backstories.</p><p>They came with false names as well as backgrounds to go with it. They both pretended to be starting over in their lives with a new career and being a part of a documentary. Only Omar messed up on his first day. He dropped a tabletop. He scratched it. The guy he was working with had told him that they were going to have to pay out of pocket to replace it and it also cost them their tips. Tips are very important to the movers. Its where they make the bulk of their income and so Omar messing up on his first day was going to cost the guy a lot. The guy he was working with a returning vet whose family was struggling with homelessness until he got the job.</p><p>He therefore couldn’t afford to lose a job as a mover. Omar learned a hard lesson and it made him realize that movers have it hard too. When they first began the company, they were just hauling junk. They didn’t have to worry about the maintenance of any of the items and that was completely different to movers. Nick meanwhile was doing their old job of hauling junk. It carries less risk or at least its supposed to and so that’s when the woman he was working with him told that her day actually gets worst going home than it is being at work. She mentioned she lives in a bad area. Nick ended up finding out that there are shootings in her neighborhood.</p><p>This woman was a married mother of two. The shooting happened two feet from where her children usually play and Nick met her kids. He met them during dinner at work. The woman’s children was around the ages of his own children and so she has hard it enough as it. It probably didn’t help that people tend to think junk haulers should be men. Yet, she came to the job everyday with a smile. Her story moved Nick. Nick and Omar later met up. They talked about the people they met and they also mentioned a new situation that cropped up. One of their franchise managers had written a response to an angry customer on Yelp and they sorta went too far.</p><p>The company has a policy about the responses they could give. The customer is always right, but even when they aren’t, they shouldn’t be insulted or convinced to never use the company again. Omar was supposed to go to work for Steve as a new employee when in fact Steve recognized him. The two had met years earlier. Steve also had a photo of when they met on his desk. He couldn’t help but recognize Omar and so Omar admitted it. He admitted he was doing “Undercover Bosses”. He also said that he and Nick weren’t happy with his responses on social media using their logo. Steve was aggressive online. And while he tried to play as something he did in the past, they found one from one month ago.</p><p>But they didn’t take Steve’s franchise away from him. They allowed him to continue on because they met his team and his team are great. They do good work. They didn’t deserve to be punished for Steve’s mistake and so that’s why they let Steve continue on and why they gave him the funding he needed to expand. Omar and Nick also came up with a no fault clause that meant any damage in moving doesn’t come out of tips and people are floundering to pay off items. The company will take on the duty of paying for them. The man that Omar worked with received a bonus check and the woman that Nick worked with received a check that will help her son get tested for his special needs.</p><p>Jessica also received a trophy that they hold for best employee out of the whole company. She helped both co-founders know what they needed to work on and they plan on making several more changes going forward.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWtnpaOxpr7CqK2eql2XvLS%2FjKmpnqWZmr%2BmedGempqoXWV%2BbnyWZmlrZaOarrS7zWZoamWVpba0u8OeZGplk6S5rbHGnmShrZ6gwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html&text=Undercover%20Boss%20Premiere%20Recap%2001%2f07%2f22%3a%20Season%2011%20Episode%201%20College%20Hunks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html&title=Undercover%20Boss%20Premiere%20Recap%2001%2f07%2f22%3a%20Season%2011%20Episode%201%20College%20Hunks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html&title=Undercover%20Boss%20Premiere%20Recap%2001%2f07%2f22%3a%20Season%2011%20Episode%201%20College%20Hunks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html&title=Undercover%20Boss%20Premiere%20Recap%2001%2f07%2f22%3a%20Season%2011%20Episode%201%20College%20Hunks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fundercover-boss-premiere-recap-01-07-22-season-11-episode-1-college-hunks.html&description=Undercover%20Boss%20Premiere%20Recap%2001%2f07%2f22%3a%20Season%2011%20Episode%201%20College%20Hunks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charles-oliveira-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charles Oliveira Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lemon-lime-hulk-party-punch-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lemon Lime HULK Party Punch Recipe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
