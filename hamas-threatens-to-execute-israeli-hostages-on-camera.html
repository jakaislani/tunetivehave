Gaza may be a tiny strip of land under heavy surveillance that’s hemmed in by the Israel Defense Forces, but it remains somewhat opaque to Israeli intelligence agencies, experts said.</p><p>There’s little question, however, that those kidnapped — who also include Israeli soldiers, elderly people and women — are in imminent and extraordinary danger.</p><p>On Monday, Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades, the terrorist group’s military arm, chillingly declared it would begin killing its prisoners if the Israeli government continues bombing Palestinian lands.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The gunmen captured Argamani, 25, as her boyfriend looked on. <span class=credit>Facebook</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Argamani pleaded with her abductors not to kill her.
