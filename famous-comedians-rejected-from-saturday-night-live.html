Typically, those auditioning go through a sort of performance on Studio 8H at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as well as a meeting with Michaels, rumored to be a personality test to make sure the future cast members can survive the rigorous hours and pressures of the fast-paced environment of live television.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The odds of getting on Saturday Night Live are zero,” Jay Mohr, who beat those odds and was on the show from 1993 to 1995, told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/arts/television/the-god-of-snl-will-see-you-now.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The New York Times</a>. “You could go to astronaut school, and you can learn how to get in a rocket and go to the moon, but there’s no ‘getting a stand-up on Saturday Night Live’ school.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Michaels believes the process is so tough because there's no formula for funny, telling the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hbr.org/2013/09/lorne-michaels data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harvard Business Review" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Harvard Business Review</a> that he looks for “never the same thing twice.” More specifically, he explains, “You’re looking for an original take on things, a level of intelligence and potential, because when people arrive, they’re raw.

But she did appear on the show as a host in 1996 during her Friends tenure. “I don’t think I was a great host either,” she continued. “It felt like you’re on this train and it’s going too fast toward a brick wall and that’s what it is...it’s going to smash, but you just do the best you can.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Stephen Colbert</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time The Late Show host <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/stephen-colbert data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen Colbert" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Stephen Colbert</a> auditioned for SNL, he was used to rejection.

But perhaps more frustrating than not earning Michaels’ approval was that he was completely forgettable to his fellow auditioner, Tracy Morgan. When the 30 Rock alum appeared on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/13/tracy-morgan-stephen-colbert-snl-audition/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Colbert’s talk show" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Colbert’s talk show</a> in 2017, the host noted that he remembered Morgan’s SNL audition. Surprised, Morgan asked how. “I was there! You and I were both there in the final callback going to network in 1996,” Colbert informed Morgan, who went on to be a cast member from 1996 to 2003. But putting his usual humorous spin on it, Colbert joked they were “too alike” to both get hired.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Mindy Kaling</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With a Dartmouth degree in playwriting, Mindy Kaling always had a way with words — which landed her on both sides of the camera on The Office in 2005, as both an actress and writer. But halfway through the second season, she got an invitation to audition for SNL while she was on contract with The Office. So she made a deal with the sitcom’s showrunner Greg Daniels that he would let her out of her contract if she was cast since it was her “childhood dream,” as she recounted on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-last-laugh-podcast-mindy-kaling-on-the-office-late-night-and-turning-down-her-dream-job-at-snl?ref=scroll" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Daily Beast’s Last Laugh podcast" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Daily Beast’s Last Laugh podcast</a>. “I auditioned and afterwards I had heard that Lorne wanted to offer me a job as a writer there, but not as a performer,” she said. “But there was some hint at that point that if I stayed on long enough, like Jason Sudeikis, that I could maybe graduate to be a performer. That was dangled to me, so I thought, well that’s pretty exciting.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Daniels kept his word and since she wasn’t cast on the show, she was locked into her contract. Kaling went on to stay on The Office for eight seasons, also serving as an executive producer and director. “It was really a life-changing thing,” she said. “I think the course of my career would have gone really differently had I left The Office and done that instead.”</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Jim Carrey</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jim-carrey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jim Carrey" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Jim Carrey</a> has topped the box office in comedies like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) and Liar Liar (1997) and dramas like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), the multi-talented performer auditioned for the late-night show but never got to perform for Michaels himself. “I wasn’t at the Jim Carrey audition, but somebody who was there said, ‘I don’t think Lorne would like it,’” Michaels told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/02/saturday-night-live-lorne-michaels-rejected-actors data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vanity Fair" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Vanity Fair</a>. “They were probably wrong, but it doesn’t matter. Or maybe they were right — who knows? No one gets it all right.” But Carrey went on to break through in another sketch comedy show, In Living Color — and eventually hosted SNL three times in 1996, 2011 and 2014.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Donald Glover</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Called “red hot” and “arguably the most prolific creator of his generation” by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/underestimate-donald-glover-at-your-own-peril-1027636 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/donald-glover data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Glover" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Donald Glover</a>’s life may have taken a seriously different detour from creating the TV comedy Atlanta and starring on Community if he had landed on the sketch comedy show. But he aired out all his grievances when he hosted and served as the musical guest as his alter ego Childish Gambino. “It’s truly an honor to be hosting SNL instead of auditioning for it, which I did — twice,” he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://youtu.be/0C23p96MI88 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in his opening monologue" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">said in his opening monologue</a> in 2018. “That’s not a joke, I’m just still pissed.” He then jokingly proved how multi-talented he is by asking other cast members about their auditions and walking around the studio singing, “I really can do anything.”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">John Goodman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The ultimate payback for not getting hired as an SNL cast member?

He had long wanted to be part of the show, even starting out by grassroots networking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I remember stalking NBC when I first moved up here in 1975,” he said, according to the book Live from New York: The Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live as Told By Its Stars, Writers and Guests. “I would always come through here just to see if I could see any of the cast members and stuff. And then I auditioned for the show in 1980 when they replaced everybody. It’s something I’ve always loved, because I was a big fan of the National Lampoon and the Radio Hour and Michael O’Donoghue.”</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Zach Galifianakis</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before Zach Galifianakis <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ew.com/article/2016/10/03/saturday-night-live-failed-auditions/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="had a beard" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">had a beard</a> and before he was a household name due to his break out role in The Hangover franchise, he faced numerous rejections, as he told on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UfGCS5LiaY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Conan O’Brien Show" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Conan O’Brien Show</a>. After his 1999 SNL audition, he did get hired — just not as on-screen talent. He was a part-time writer for just a few of the episodes that year. While it's not uncommon for a cast member to start as a writer (cases in point: Sudeikis, Colin Jost and Bowen Yang), Galifinakis didn't make it to the Studio 8H stage until he hosted in 2010. He hosted two more times in 2011 and 2013.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Aubrey Plaza</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delaware-born Aubrey Plaza was obsessed with SNL from a young age, ever since her mother introduced her to the show. “I wanted to be on that show for as long as I could remember,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/14/aubrey-plaza-parks-and-recreation-comedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Guardian" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">The Guardian</a>. So she made an action plan, researching how other cast members made the cut. She followed their paths, going to improv school in Philadelphia and later at the Upright Citizens Brigade, putting her in all the right circles, even performing with future SNL writer John Mulaney. And then she went the extra distance by interning on the show in 2005. Three years later, she finally got to audition but didn’t get an offer. However, the rejection gave her the opportunity to show off her comedy chops in the 2009 movie Funny People and then in the series Parks and Recreation.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Paul Reubens</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pee-wee Herman on Saturday nights instead of Saturday mornings?

It was a year Lorne Michaels did not produce. I walked in the room, [saw comic Gilbert Gottfried], and I said, 'It’s not going to be both of us. We’re the same type of performer.' I knew then I wasn’t going to get it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He was right, but the rejection gave him the chance to develop the Pee-wee character on stage and later on the silver screen in Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and on TV as Pee-wee’s Playhouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVonZqln6rAbq%2FOppydoZGjwG6%2BxKOcnKyVmXqnvs6mZKyZpKq%2Fpa3YZqWin5ipeq211Z4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html&text=10%20Famous%20Comedians%20Who%20Were%20Rejected%20by%20%27Saturday%20Night%20Live%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html&title=10%20Famous%20Comedians%20Who%20Were%20Rejected%20by%20%27Saturday%20Night%20Live%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html&title=10%20Famous%20Comedians%20Who%20Were%20Rejected%20by%20%27Saturday%20Night%20Live%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html&title=10%20Famous%20Comedians%20Who%20Were%20Rejected%20by%20%27Saturday%20Night%20Live%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamous-comedians-rejected-from-saturday-night-live.html&description=10%20Famous%20Comedians%20Who%20Were%20Rejected%20by%20%27Saturday%20Night%20Live%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./a-tour-through-the-brand-new-academy-museum-of-motion-pictures.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Tour Through the Brand New Academy Museum of Motion Pictures | Features">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tyler-crispen-net-worth-325793.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyler Crispen Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
