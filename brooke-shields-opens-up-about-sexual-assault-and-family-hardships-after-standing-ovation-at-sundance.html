In the raw film, Shields talks about her career, a sexual assault she faced as a young adult, and her complicated relationship with her late mother.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Shields began her career as a child model and got her big break playing a 12-year-old child prostitute in the film Pretty Baby, from which the documentary draws its name. In the film, the young Shields kisses Kieth Carradine, who was 29 at the time. It was Shields’ first kiss.</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>From the start, Shields played overly sexualized characters in films like Blue Lagoon and Endless Love. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> review of the documentary, Shields describes Blue Lagoon as an attempt to sell her “actual sexual awakening” and speaks about Endless Love director, Franco Zeffirelli, painfully twisting her toe when he was frustrated with her performance while filming a sex scene. “Sometimes I’m amazed that I survived any of it,” she says about her early career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Standing ovation for Brooke Shields at the Sundance premiere for her doc Pretty Baby: “This is a whole new chapter for me” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ANbIefHNUj</a></p>— Mia Galuppo (@miagaluppo) <a href=#>January 21, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>At the age of 16, Shields faced public scrutiny when family friend, photographer Gary Gross, tried to sell nude photos he had taken of the actor when she was 10 years old. Shields’ mother sued him for the images and during the resulting trial, the young Shields was publicly shamed on the stand due to the image the media had crafted of her. The court ultimately decided Gross owned the images and was legally entitled to do whatever he wanted with them. Those images were eventually published by a subsidiary magazine of Playboy. Shields described the incident like this:</p><p>“It was the way I was treated by the men associated with the whole thing. It was as low-rent, low-class — there was zero integrity in it, and to me that was so angering and hurtful. I mean, the entirety of my life, over and over and over and over again, it was, ‘She’s a pretty face.’ ‘She’s a sex symbol.’ And that always just seared me because the nerdy kind of dorky person who was creative and intelligent was at the core of who I was.”</p><p data-characters=686 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>After taking a break from acting and graduating from Princeton, Shields had regained some of her confidence. She decided to return to the entertainment business and while vulnerable, was taken advantage of by a professional contact. Accoridng to Shields, she met with the unnamed producer for a business dinner and was raped when she went to his hotel room to call a taxi. In the film, Shields says, “I didn’t fight that much. I just absolutely froze. I thought my one ‘no’ should have been enough.” After the assault, she said she came to the realization, “the system had never once come to help me…so, I just had to get stronger on my own.”</p><p data-characters=660 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>The actor also spoke of her complex relationship with her late mother, Teri Shields. In the documentary, she remembers hiding as a child with her friend, actor Laura Linney, when Teri came home drunk. The two girls would wait for Shields’ mother to fall asleep before they would come out. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> at Sundance, Shields told the publication her mother’s drinking caused her to grow up at a young age in order to take care of her mother. “I also said goodbye to her every time she drank. She wasn’t present. I knew who she was capable of being because it was in there,” she said about Teri, who passed away in 2012.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Honored to share the key art for <a href=#>#PrettyBaby</a> with you 🤍 I’m so excited for you to see this documentary, premiering at <a href=#>@sundancefest</a> this week and coming to <a href=#>@hulu</a> soon!! ☀️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qBeRigiXRA</a></p>— Brooke Shields (@BrookeShields) <a href=#>January 17, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=911 data-injectable=true>Pretty Baby follows Shields as she comes into her own, both career-wise and personally. After years of having her image dictated by others, Shields discovered a penchant for comedy after playing Joey’s stalker in Friends, which led to her starring in the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan and notable guest appearances in shows like Hannah Montana and That 70’s Show. In her personal life, Shields became an advocate for parents suffering with postpartum depression and brought awareness to the condition with her book Down Came The Rain and by appearing on television programs like The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>The documentary offers a vulnerable look at the life of a woman who survived the horrors of being an American female celebrity and made it to the other side of the lens. For those who couldn’t make it to Sundance, Pretty Baby will be available to stream on Hulu at a later date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Svs7vOpJxmq5iesq2w0mamqZ2eqHq2vIyamaitpGLApsTUmqNmmaOorra402aYp5xdm66utcuyZKGZopnAqbXPrGSanqSav26%2F05qlnaGenHqwwsCtoKimXZbBbr%2FUp5uappOafA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html&text=Brooke%20Shields%20opens%20up%20about%20sexual%20assault%20and%20family%20hardships%20after%20standing%20ovation%20at%20Sundance&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html&title=Brooke%20Shields%20opens%20up%20about%20sexual%20assault%20and%20family%20hardships%20after%20standing%20ovation%20at%20Sundance" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html&title=Brooke%20Shields%20opens%20up%20about%20sexual%20assault%20and%20family%20hardships%20after%20standing%20ovation%20at%20Sundance" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html&title=Brooke%20Shields%20opens%20up%20about%20sexual%20assault%20and%20family%20hardships%20after%20standing%20ovation%20at%20Sundance" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrooke-shields-opens-up-about-sexual-assault-and-family-hardships-after-standing-ovation-at-sundance.html&description=Brooke%20Shields%20opens%20up%20about%20sexual%20assault%20and%20family%20hardships%20after%20standing%20ovation%20at%20Sundance" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-do-i-know-if-my-audi-has-folding-mirrors-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How do i know if my audi has folding mirrors">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rachel-leblanc-bazinet-camille-leblanc-bazinets-twin-sister-weightlifter-instagram-wiki-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel Leblanc-Bazinet: Camille Leblanc-Bazinets Twin Sister, Weightlifter, Instagram, Wiki, Biog">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
