Neil asked me what type of music I listened to growing up, and I responded, ‘it was always country in our house.’ Neil stopped me right there and said, ‘let’s write that.’ The reason we decided to name the album after this track is because, at the end of the day, that is how all of this started for me. If it wasn’t for country music playing in my house growing up, this dream wouldn’t exist.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: Who/what were some of your inspirations when creating this album in particular?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG:</b> “In terms of songwriting, some songs on the record are autobiographical, and some were me putting myself in someone else’s shoes. The songs (such as ‘<a href=#>Quote the Bible</a>’ and ‘<a href=#>Roots Grow Down</a>’) that are personal to me and my life are inspired heavily by my parents and my wife.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: How did you decide which tracks were going to make it onto the album?

Performing the songs live and posting teasers on social media have been helpful ways to be able to tell how the fans respond to each song.”</span></p><p class=s5><span class=s4><b>CS: What is your favorite song on the album and why?</b></span></p><p class=s5><span class=s2><b>BG: </b>“That’s a tough one.
