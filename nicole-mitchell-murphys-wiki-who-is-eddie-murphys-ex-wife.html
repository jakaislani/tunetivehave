She is also the ex-wife to well –known actor, Eddie Murphy.</p><h2><span id=Nicole_Mitchell_Murphy_Age_Early_Life_Family_and_Education>Nicole Mitchell Murphy Age, Early Life, Family and Education</span></h2><p>Nicole Ronnette Mitchell was born under the Capricorn Zodiac sign on 5 January 1968, in Sacramento, California, USA, to Ellen and Eddie Mitchell – her three siblings are Nathan, Trevor and Darius. Her father was an African-American US Air Force pilot, while her mother was a white housewife. When Nicole was a kid, her parents separated.</p><p>She was brought up mainly in a single-mother household. From her mother, she learned independence and self-confidence. Her parents would later reunite. Sadly, her mother passed away on 4 November 2019.</p><p>Not much is known about Nicole’s upbringing or education background, however, it’s recorded that her modeling career began early.</p><h2><span id=Nicole_Murphy_Career_and_Rise_to_Stardom>Nicole Murphy Career and Rise to Stardom</span></h2><p>As a 10-year-old girl, Nicole was already in the print and catwalk modeling business. At the age of 13 years, <a rel=nofollow href=#>she</a> was already strutting the catwalk for Fred Modelling Agency. She has worked with various industry leaders such as Ungaro, Chanel, and Valentino.</p><p>From a young age, Nicole would travel from one photoshoot venue to another in a limousine or fly first class. Consequently, even when she met with Eddie Murphy, she was already used to the glitzy life of showbiz.</p><p>Later, Nicole branched out into other careers. She has always been keen on looking good and keeping fit, which led her to launch the Nicole Murphy Fitness brand, offering tutorials on keeping fit. In addition, the brand gives tips on nutrition including posting healthy recipes.</p><p>Nicole Murphy is an entrepreneur, running a firm known as FLP (Friendship, Love, and Peace), through which she sells her personally designed jewelry as well as other merchandise.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/main/thumbs/1197766_Nicole-Mitchell-Murphy.jpg></p><p>She is also the proprietor of Zobela, which is a firm dealing in skin and beauty care products.</p><p>However, it is her modeling and acting career that has made her face so well known.&nbsp; She was the executive producer of the TV reality series, “ <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hollywood Exes</a>”, a series she launched following her divorce from Eddie Murphy. In the three series in which she was a cast member, she traces the friendship and support that the ex-wives of the rich and famous develop. Their network is full of fun, drama, and covering each other’s backs.</p><p>Nicole had a role in “Just Love’, a 2016 movie, and also appeared in” Shut the Fuck Up”(2009). Nicole was the host of the TV show “Global Beauty Masters” (2014) that brought together experts in the beauty industry, to give tips on looking good by following various beauty regimens.

He was a bachelor following a string of unsuccessful relationships, and Nicole and Eddie dated for several years before he proposed to her.</p><p>The wedding was an exclusive affair held at the Plaza Hotel in New York City on 18 March 1993. Queen Latifah, Bruce Willis and Sugar Ray Leonard were among the 500 guests, celebrities, and family members that graced the occasion, which reportedly cost the couple $ 1.5 million. Their firstborn daughter, Bria, was a flower girl.</p><p>Eddie and Nicole have five <a rel=nofollow href=#>children</a>, with the eldest daughter Bria being born in 1989.</p><p>The others are Myles (1992), Shane Audria (1994), Zola (1999), and Bella Zohra (2002). Nicole is a grandmother since Myles is married and has a daughter named Elvie. Nicole and Eddie’s marriage lasted from 1993 to2005, when Nicole filed for divorce due to what she called “irreconcilable differences.” It was rumored that there were reports of infidelity – Nicole was allegedly paid a settlement of $15 million, however, the divorce was an amicable agreement, to bring up their children as responsible parents.</p><p>Although Nicole is still regarded as Eddie Murphy’s ex-, she has been involved with other men. &nbsp;In 2009, she became engaged to Michael Strahan of the New York Giants, and co-hosted the “Live Michael & Kelly “show with him. The engagement lasted until 2014, however, the relationship then ended.</p><p>Nicole set social media abuzz in 2017 when a picture appeared of her kissing Antoine Fuqua, director of “Training Day” – the problem was that Fuqua was married to Lela Rochon.</p><p>This scandal forced Nicole to apologize to Lela, as wel as her own family for the distress she caused. She has also been seen with various men who she was rumored to be dating. Currently, Nicole is not linked to anybody romantically, amd remains single.
