Mac Davis was a country singer, songwriter, and actor, known for writing popular Elvis Presley hits, like “In the Ghetto,” “A Little Less Conversation” and “Memories” alongside solo hits like “Baby Don’t Get Hooked on Me,” “One Hell of a Woman,” and “Stop and Smell the Roses.”</p><p>Mac Davis died on September 29, 2020, at age 78, following heart surgery in Nashville. According to a tweet from his family, he was “critically ill following heart surgery in Nashville.”</p><p>Davis was born in Texas on Jan. 21, 1942. At 16, upon graduating from high school, Davis left Lubbock to join his mother, Edith, in Atlanta. It was there, around the age of 20, that Davis began performing in bands and writing songs while working as a “promotions man” for record labels, trying to secure radio play for their releases. His work in that capacity for Liberty Records eventually landed him in Los Angeles and in the orbit of Nancy Sinatra, who then hired him to write songs for her and her company.</p><p>After writing for Sinatra and the pop community around her, Davis’ songs drew the attention of Elvis Presley, who was enjoying a comeback. The combination yielded several hits, including “In the Ghetto,” “Memories” and “Don’t Cry Daddy.” (Presley’s first recording of a Davis song, “A Little Less Conversation” from 1968 and co-written with arranger and producer Billy Strange, wasn’t an immediate success but went on to reach No. 1 in the UK in a remix by Junkie XL.) Glen Campbell, Dolly Parton, Bobby Goldsboro, and Kenny Rogers and The First Edition all subsequently had success with Davis-penned works.</p><p>Through the ’70s, Davis began developing his own career as a recording artist, scoring a Grammy nomination for his 1972 chart-topper “Baby Don’t Get Hooked On Me.” By the middle of the decade, Davis was a ubiquitous quantity in American popular life, hosting his own variety show (like Sonny & Cher, Johnny Cash and many others); by its close, he had begun appearing in films, too.</p><p>Davis’ songwriting career peaked in the ’70s, but his personal recording career reached its apex in the ’80s, on the strength of such hits as “It’s Hard To Be Humble” (cited by Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna in the song “Loyalty”) and “Texas In My Rearview Mirror.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lise-kristen-gerard-age></span>Lise Kristen Gerard Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lise Kristen Gerard’s age is unclear. Her husband Mac Davis was born on January 21, 1942, in Lubbock, Texas, and died on September 29, 2020, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 78.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mac-davis-wife-lise-kristen-gerard></span>Mac Davis Wife Lise Kristen Gerard<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mac Davis married his wife Lise Kristen Gerard in 1982 when she was 24. They remained married until his death in September 2020. Davis was previously married to Fran Cook from 1963–1968 and Sarah Barg from 1971–1976. Both marriages ended in divorce. Sarah Barg left Davis in 1976 for Glen Campbell and had one child, Dillon, with Campbell. She also left Campbell shortly after Dillon’s birth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=children></span>Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lise Kristen Gerard and Mac Davis had two children; Noah Claire Davis and Cody Luke Davis. Davis also had a son, Joel Scott, from his first marriage to Fran Cook.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=mac-davis-death></span>Mac Davis Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mac Davis died on September 29, 2020, at the age of 78, in Nashville following heart surgery. His manager, Jim Morey, confirmed his death in a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;on Facebook. Morey wrote: “It’s with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of Mac Davis. He was surrounded by the love of his life and wife of 38 years, Lise, and his sons Scott, Noah, and Cody. Mac has been my client for over 40 years, and more importantly.. my best friend. He was a music legend but his most important work was that as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and friend.”</p><p>Reba McEntire said in a statement: “Thank you, dear Lord Jesus, for letting us know the man to whom you gave the most incredible talent. He entertained and spread joy to so many people. What a wonderful legacy he left all of us with his music. Mac was one of a kind. I’m so blessed to have been one of his many friends.”</p><p>BMI President and CEO Mike O’Neil said, “He was the songwriter behind some of the most iconic and timeless songs that transcend genres and generations and was named a BMI Icon in 2015. Beyond his extraordinary talent, Mac was a dedicated friend and advocate for songwriters everywhere.”</p><p>Country star Kenny Chesney said: “A small-town boy who’d achieved the greatest kinds of fame, he remained a good guy, a family man. That was Mac: a giant heart, quick to laugh, and a bigger creative spirit. I was blessed to have it shine on me. And Mac, who was joyous, funny and created a family around him, never stopped writing great songs, creating music and inspiring everyone around him.”</p><p>Sarah Trahern, CEO of CMA said in a statement: “Today our country community lost an amazing entertainer, songwriter and artist. I remember watching Mac’s TV show as a kid as well as his three years co-hosting the CMA Awards with Barbara Mandrell, which proved his command of the TV medium as well as the music.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mac Davis’ cause of death was complications of his recent heart surgery.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mac Davis’ net worth is estimated to be $12 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foba0sYykqaKrpJq7brPEq5irnKNiu6bAjLCmq6yYYq%2Bqu8armKmgqWKzoq%2FTZpqaqpWav26t1pqpnatdlrulecuinZ5lo6m8s8WO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&text=Lise%20Kristen%20Gerards%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=Lise%20Kristen%20Gerards%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=Lise%20Kristen%20Gerards%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&title=Lise%20Kristen%20Gerards%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flise-kristen-gerards-net-worth-biography-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html&description=Lise%20Kristen%20Gerards%20net%20worth%2c%20biography%2c%20fact%2c%20career%2c%20awards%20and%20life%20story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ramune-flavors-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Ramune Flavors, Ranked in a Taste Test">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dollar-tree-canned-food-haul.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dollar Tree Canned Food for Your Next Haul">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
